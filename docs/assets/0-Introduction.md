# ESDT Standard on MultiversX

The ESDT (eStandard Digital Token) standard is a powerful and flexible framework for creating and managing tokens and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the MultiversX blockchain. This document explores the concepts, advantages, and comparisons with token standards on other blockchains.

You can find the official documentation for ESDT [here](https://docs.multiversx.com/tokens/esdt-tokens) but this is a resume of the most important concepts.

## Concepts

### What is ESDT?

The ESDT standard provides a native and efficient way to issue, manage, and use tokens on the MultiversX blockchain. Unlike ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards on Ethereum, ESDT tokens are first-class citizens in the MultiversX ecosystem, benefiting from the network's scalability and speed.

### Key Features of ESDT

- **Native Integration**: ESDT tokens are deeply integrated into the MultiversX protocol, enabling seamless transactions and interactions.
- **High Efficiency**: With the high throughput of the MultiversX network, ESDT transactions are fast and cost-effective.
- **Flexibility**: ESDT supports fungible tokens (similar to ERC-20), non-fungible tokens (similar to ERC-721), and semi-fungible tokens (SFTs).
- **Security**: ESDT leverages the robust security features of the MultiversX blockchain.
- **Interoperability**: ESDT tokens are common to both the main network and sovereign chains, allowing seamless reuse of technologies and smart contracts across the entire MultiversX ecosystem.

## Advantages

### Performance

ESDT tokens benefit from the high performance of the MultiversX network. The adaptive state sharding and Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS) consensus mechanism ensure that the network can handle a high number of transactions per second (TPS), making ESDT transactions faster and more efficient compared to other blockchains.

### Cost-Effectiveness

Transaction fees on MultiversX are significantly lower than on many other blockchains. This cost-effectiveness makes ESDT tokens an attractive option for both developers and users.

### Interoperability

ESDT tokens can be seamlessly integrated with various decentralized applications (dApps) on the MultiversX network. The native support for ESDT in the MultiversX wallet and explorer enhances user experience and accessibility. Additionally, ESDT tokens are fully interoperable across the main network and sovereign chains, enabling the reuse of technologies and smart contracts seamlessly.

## Comparison with Other Chains

Let's compare the ESDT standard on MultiversX with token standards on other popular blockchains:

### ESDT vs ERC-20 (Ethereum)

- **Performance**: ESDT on MultiversX offers higher TPS and lower latency compared to ERC-20 on Ethereum, which is often hindered by network congestion.
- **Cost**: Transaction fees for ESDT are generally lower than for ERC-20, where gas fees can be prohibitively expensive during peak times.
- **Integration**: ESDT tokens are natively integrated into the MultiversX protocol, while ERC-20 tokens rely on smart contracts, adding a layer of complexity and potential security vulnerabilities.

### ESDT vs BEP-20 (Binance Smart Chain)

- **Performance**: Both MultiversX and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) offer high TPS, but MultiversX's adaptive state sharding can provide superior scalability.
- **Decentralization**: MultiversX aims for a higher degree of decentralization compared to BSC, which is relatively more centralized.
- **Ecosystem**: While BSC has a large ecosystem, MultiversX is rapidly growing with a focus on robust infrastructure and security.

### ESDT vs SPL (Solana)

- **Performance**: Solana's SPL standard operates on a high-performance blockchain with low latency and high TPS. MultiversX also offers high performance but with additional benefits from its adaptive state sharding.
- **Cost**: Both Solana and MultiversX offer low transaction fees, but MultiversX’s approach to scalability can provide more consistent fee structures.
- **Interoperability**: Solana focuses on speed and efficiency, while MultiversX ensures seamless interoperability between its main network and sovereign chains, facilitating broader use cases and integration.

### ESDT vs DOT (Polkadot)

- **Performance**: Polkadot’s parachain architecture offers high performance by enabling parallel processing of transactions. MultiversX’s adaptive state sharding similarly enhances performance by distributing network load.
- **Cost**: Both networks aim for low transaction fees, but MultiversX’s fee structure may be more predictable due to its unified approach to scalability.
- **Interoperability**: Polkadot excels in cross-chain interoperability through its relay chain and parachains. MultiversX provides strong interoperability within its ecosystem and ensures seamless technology reuse across its main network and sovereign chains.

## Use Cases

### Fungible Tokens

ESDT fungible tokens can be used for a variety of purposes, including utility tokens, stablecoins, and governance tokens. Their efficiency and low transaction costs make them ideal for high-frequency transactions.

### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

ESDT NFTs can represent unique digital assets such as art, collectibles, and virtual real estate. The native support for NFTs on MultiversX allows for efficient and secure management of digital ownership.

### Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFTs)

ESDT SFTs combine the features of fungible and non-fungible tokens. They are useful in scenarios where a limited quantity of identical items need to be managed. For example:
- **Gaming**: In-game items such as weapons, armor, or consumables that exist in limited quantities.
- **Event Tickets**: Tickets for events where each ticket is unique but belongs to a specific event or category.
- **Collectibles**: Limited edition collectibles where each edition has a specific quantity.

## Getting Started with ESDT

To start creating and managing ESDT tokens, refer to the [ESDT Documentation](https://docs.multiversx.com) for detailed guides and examples. Whether you are a developer looking to integrate ESDT tokens into your dApp or a user interested in exploring the MultiversX ecosystem, the ESDT standard provides a powerful and flexible solution.

## Conclusion

The ESDT standard on MultiversX offers a robust, efficient, and cost-effective way to create and manage digital tokens. With its native integration, high performance, low fees, and full interoperability between the main network and sovereign chains, ESDT is well-positioned to become a leading standard in the blockchain space. Explore the potential of ESDT and leverage the capabilities of the MultiversX network to build the next generation of decentralized applications.
