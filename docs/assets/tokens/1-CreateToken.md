# Create an ESDT Token

It is really easy to create your own token on MultiversX. You can create a fungible token using the ESDT standard. Here is a step-by-step guide to create a token using the wallet dapp.

## Prerequisites

Before you start creating a token, make sure you have the following:
- A properly secured wallet with a small amount of $EGLD for gas fees.
- A tokenomics plan for your token, including the token name, ticker, supply, and more.
- An idea of the different permissions and features you want to enable for your token.


## Steps to Create a Token

As we just said, we will be using the official wallet to create our new token.
So go to [wallet.multiversx.com](https://wallet.multiversx.com) and connect your wallet.
