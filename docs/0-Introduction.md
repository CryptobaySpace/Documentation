# Introduction to the Cryptobay Guides


Welcome to the MultiversX guide by [Cryptobay](https://cryptobay.space), you will find here many ressources to build in the MultiversX ecosystem
Being myself a builder and validator on this ecosystem since years, I already create different solutions and products in addition to my understanding of the nodes management. 

I decided to share this knowledge and help bootstrap new ideas that wish to build on a cutting edge blockchain with a vibrant community.
This documentation is separate in 3 main sections:

- **Dapp**: Learn to create a web applications for interact with the blockchain, from simple backend to a dedicated frontend until their deployment and maintenance. If you have an idea to make real, this is the place where to start.
- **NodeRunner**: Learn everything that you need to know about Observers and Validators. Run your nodes and maintain them with our methods and tools.
- **Sovereign Chain**: Discover how to run you own blockchain powered by the MultiversX technologie with the capacity to benefit from the main network.

These aspects will cover most of the MultiversX technologies and we will see how to use it to create outstanding solutions in this ecosystem.

I still see people struggling finding clear guides for bootstrap their ideas and especially where to start to have a proper structure that can evolve and keep its robustness over the time.
