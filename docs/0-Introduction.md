# Introduction to the Cryptobay Guides

Welcome to the MultiversX guide by [Cryptobay](https://cryptobay.space). Here, you will find numerous resources to help you build in the MultiversX ecosystem. As a builder and validator in this ecosystem for years, I have created various solutions and products, and have extensive knowledge of node management.

I decided to share this knowledge to help bootstrap new ideas for those who wish to build on a cutting-edge blockchain with a vibrant community. This documentation is divided into three main sections:

- **Dapp**: Learn to create web applications that interact with the blockchain, from simple backend services to dedicated frontends, and their deployment and maintenance. If you have an idea to bring to life, this is the place to start.
- **NodeRunner**: Learn everything you need to know about Observers and Validators. Run and maintain your nodes with our methods and tools.
- **Sovereign Chain**: Discover how to run your own blockchain powered by MultiversX technology, while benefiting from the main network.

These sections will cover most of the MultiversX technologies and show you how to use them to create outstanding solutions within this ecosystem.

I have observed many people struggling to find clear guides to bootstrap their ideas, especially guides that provide a proper structure to ensure robustness over time.

## Dapp

An important aspect of any blockchain project is the interactions from users or off-chain logic.
