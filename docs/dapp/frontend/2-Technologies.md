## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

## Vite

Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, providing extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) without any bundling.
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
  
## Chakra UI

Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications. It is built on top of Emotion, a popular CSS-in-JS library.
